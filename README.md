# Brickbloom

Brickbloom is an AI image generator that was built using [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) and [Replicate](https://replicate.com/). The text-to-image model this app uses is a fine tune of [SDXL](https://replicate.com/stability-ai/sdxl). Learn more about SDXL [here](https://replicate.com/guides/stable-diffusion) and more about training your own models [here](https://replicate.com/guides/stable-diffusion/fine-tuning). Checkout and run the model I trained, [SDXL-Lego](https://replicate.com/marydotdev/sdxl-lego).
